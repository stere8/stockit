## ✨ Overview

Small businesses often rely on **manual spreadsheets**, outdated software, or no tracking at all — resulting in:
- ❌ Inventory inaccuracies  
- 🕓 Wasted time on repetitive tasks  
- 💸 Lost sales due to stockouts or overstocking  

**StockIT** was created to solve this.

> 🧠 **Mission:** Deliver a free, simple, and scalable inventory management tool for startups and small shops.

Developed as part of my **Engineering Thesis** at the University of Economy (Bydgoszcz, 2025), StockIT combines **.NET 8**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **Bootstrap** to deliver a clean, modern, cloud-ready inventory system.
